# React Reddit
Reddit clone with [Node](http://nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), and [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/). Only supports the major operations: self-posts, linked-posts, upvotes, account registration, logins, and post and comment creation. The styling is very minimal.

# Local installation
To run it locally:
* Clone the repository
* Install dependencies with ```npm install```
* Run the server with ```npm start``` (Note this will package all the js files with browserify first)
